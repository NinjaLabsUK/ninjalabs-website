description: Started my apprenticeship here in 2014. Here I was able to determine what languages I enjoyed working with and was a huge part in deciding what I wanted to pursue as a developer.

My main responsibility was the development of various parts of our in-house system for monitoring PCâ€™s around the UK (advertising displays at airports & shopping centres, car park signs etc.). I looked after the development of the mobile app, website and the majority of the API.

It was at this point that I was exposed to my first frontend framework AngularJS (yes version 1) and I realised this was the type of work I enjoyed. I went on to learn Angular and Ionic whilst I was here.
