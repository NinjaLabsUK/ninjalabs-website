description: Started my apprenticeship here in 2014. Here I was able to determine what languages I enjoyed working with and was a huge part in deciding what I wanted to pursue as a developer.

My main responsibility was the development of various parts of our in-house system for monitoring PCâ€™s around the UK (advertising displays at airports & shopping centres, car park signs etc.). I looked after the development of the mobile app, website and the majority of the API.
