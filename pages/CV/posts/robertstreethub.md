At the The Robert Street Hub in a 4 - 5 developers, I worked on our e-commerce fashion site alongside other internal applications. The site was written in Liquid (Shopify templating language), Javascript, SCSS and NodeJS.

I also worked on a Colour swatch tool that was deployed to Lambda and connected to a MongoDB database. It was able to take on the usual customer traffic as well as the surge over black friday.
